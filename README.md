# fuck0ff
Possibly the first theme tweak for iOS 13 using a 0-day vulnerability instead of a jailbreak.
## ToDo
- [ ] Add template extractor to fuck0ff.sh 
- [ ] Add checks to buildfuck.py
- [ ] Add instructions on how to setup iSH to get buildfuck.py to work
- [ ] Add example images and description text for this "tweak"
- [ ] Add a couple themes so one can test without needing to build themes
- [ ] Implement a Syntax
- [ ] Add Documentation on usage
- [ ] Publish this on github
- [ ] Credit people who make this possible
